# Cool Projects

A repository for noteworthy projects. 

## Red Team Resources and SBOM   

Websites can be built on demand for the *Red Team Resources* and *SBOM* repositories with MkDocs.

### Building the sites

MkDocs is installed with pip. It can be downloaded via a script from [this](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) location.

1. Run the script with the command `python get-pip.py.`

2. MkDocs can then be installed with the command `pip install mkdocs`.

3. Build the website with the command `mkdocs build`

4. The site is served with the command `mkdocs serve`. The default address is 127.0.0.1:8000.

5. That's it.

## Dataset

It was decided an on-demand site for the dataset project was not necessary given its limited scope. But it's still pretty cool. Feel free to look around. 

See the individual project readme for further information.
