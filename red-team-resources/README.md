## Expanding the Attack Chain

## Introduction

This resource provides an assessment of new attack tools and provide insights and practical solutions to contemporary cyber-security challenges. The functionality and impact of each tool has been mapped to a corresponding stage of the attack chain. The approach was intended to enhance the understanding of how different tools can be utilized to infiltrate, exploit, and persist within a target environment. How defenders can detect and respond to such attacks has also been considered. It is designed to be deployed in line with attack steps outlined in the Mitre Att&ck chain. 

## Evasion Capabilities

The first aspect considered in the evaluation process was the ability of the tools to evade modern antivirus solutions. Each tool was tested against standard commercial and open-source antivirus products to determine their detection rates. Tools that exhibited a high evasion rate without compromising functionality were given priority. This focus ensures that red teams can simulate sophisticated attacks while providing blue teams with opportunities to improve their detection and response mechanisms.

## Traceability and Forensics

The assessment also considered tool traceability. While some tools aimed to fly under the radar entirely, others were found to leave purposeful traces to be analyzed by blue teams during post-incident investigations. Traceability is useful because it offers an invaluable learning opportunity for both offensive and defensive teams. It affords an opportunity to understand the indicators of compromise (IOCs) left behind by various attacks. These insights contribute to improved forensic analysis and incident response capabilities.

## Documentation and Testing

Extensive documentation played a crucial role in the evaluation process. Each tool was scrutinized based on the clarity and comprehensiveness of its documentation. This includes installation guides, usage instructions, and troubleshooting solutions. Careful documentation ensures that both red and blue teams can effectively understand and utilize the tools in their respective roles. Rigorous testing validated their effectiveness in various attack scenarios. 

## Collaborative Learning

The research task aimed to foster collaboration between red and blue teams with an emphasis on knowledge-sharing and mutual learning. By providing detailed documentation and evaluation results, the resource facilitates cross-team understanding. These insights empower both sides to leverage this research to improve their capabilities. A collaborative approach empowers defenders to stay one step ahead of emerging threats while enabling attackers to refine their tactics within an evolving landscape.
