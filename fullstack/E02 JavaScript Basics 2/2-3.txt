The code executes the following:

Task1 to execution...
Task2 to execution...
Task3 to execution...
Last code line executed!
Task3 finished!
Task1 finished!
Task2 finished!

The print() and execute() functions are called with different strings and task times. 
The print() function is passed to execute() as a callback. 
Execute() calls print() with the string and task time as arguments. 
setTimeout() is used in print() to log a message to the console after the specified task time has elapsed. 
This means the messages are not logged immediately, but after the specified time for each call to print(). 
The code logs "Task1 to execution...", "Task2 to execution...", "Task3 to execution...", and "Last code line executed!" immediately.
"Task3 finished!", "Task1 finished!", and "Task2 finished!" is logged after the specified task times have elapsed for each call to print().
