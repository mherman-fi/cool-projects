# Cyber-Attack Data-Analysis

## Dataset Breakdown

All sensitive information has been redacted or removed from this project. It was decided to leave the altered file in place in order to give readers a sense of the thought processes behind the project. Please contact me directly for more information.


The dataset was generated between 01.07.2023 and 02.07.2023. Non-malicious web traffic was generated over the following sites: 10.40.20.110 (win11-1.rt.vle.fi), 10.40.20.100 (win10-1.rt.vle.fi), 10.40.20.101 (win10-2.rt.vle.fi) and 10.40.20.10 (dc.rt.vle.fi). Malicious traffic originates from [REDACTED]. The exfiltration destination has been manually altered to appear as [REDACTED] in origin. The altered IP is [REDACTED]


Attacks do not correspond precisely to the scheduled times outlined in the Excel sheet (unavailable here). This is in some cases a by-product of concatenation. There appears to be a printing delay of approximately 1 minute in the logs. Precise attack timestamps are provided below. Timestamp deviation was calculated to be 0.74 seconds. The minimum was 0.1 seconds. The maximum was 5 seconds.  A Jupyter Lab file has been included in a convenient ready-to-use format for analysis.

## Attacks
| Tool            | Timestamp          | Log         | UID           |
|-----------------|--------------------|-------------|---------------|
| [REDACTED]      | [REDACTED]         | HTTP, conn  | [REDACTED]    |
| [REDACTED]      | [REDACTED]         | HTTP, conn  | [REDACTED]    |
| [REDACTED]      | [REDACTED]         | HTTP, conn  | [REDACTED]    |
| [REDACTED]      | [REDACTED]         | HTTP, conn  | [REDACTED]    |
| [REDACTED]      | [REDACTED]         | DNS         | [REDACTED]    |
| [REDACTED]      | [REDACTED]         | HTTP        | [REDACTED]    |
| [REDACTED]      | [REDACTED]         | Conn        | [REDACTED]    |

## Indications of Attack
Most IoAs can be found simply by searching for a specific string (eg: “nmap”). This information typically originates from the [REDACTED] field in the [REDACTED] log. In the case of the [REDACTED] attack the most relevant field is the [REDACTED. For [REDACTED], the most relevant fields are [REDACTED]. The majority of [REDACTED] entries are malicious. They are identifiable from the string [REDACTED]. Students should be able to identify these reasonably easily. 


The first [REDACTED] attacks do not overlap. The [REDACTED] attack will be very easy to identify. The [REDACTED] field will provide the necessary information. Exfiltration occurs in the [REDACTED] attack, however. Students will in this case have to search for a suspicious IP address in [REDACTED]. The relevant field is [REDACTED].
